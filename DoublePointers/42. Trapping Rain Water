    Double Pointers

    Start from two sides
    The size of trapping water is defined by the less height
    So if left height is less than right height
        calculate in left
    if right is less than left
        calculate in right
    predefine two max value: left max and right max
        if left height of that pointer is less than left max, 
            trap water, update the size of water
        if left height of that pointer is larger than left max
            not trap water, update max left
        same as right
