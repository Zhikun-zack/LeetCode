    Math same as 793

    how many 0 means how many 10 can be extracted
    means how many 2 * 5 pairs can we extract from the equation
    every even value can extract 2 so the number of 2 will larger than 5
    so we need to find how many 5 can we get from n
    then the number of 5 will be the number of  2 * 5
    will be the number of 10
    will be the number of trailing zeros

    and also 25 will extract two 5
    125 will extract three 5
    so we also need to sonsider those numbers
